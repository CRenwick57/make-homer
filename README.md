# Homer maker

plug xy coordinates into the makeHomer method to make homer (origin point is top-left of his "head")

If you're not familiar with java:

scroll all the way to the bottom of the code and you should see this: 

 public static void main(String[] args){
 
            makeHomer(400,100);
            
       }
        
Just change 400 and 100 in that bit to anywhere you want Homer to show up on your screen.
